We saw many kinds of animals there such as tiger snakes collection butterfly collections etc. We looked around in that Zoo and also took pictures of those animals.

That guy jumped off the roof and came at Renji.It’s an orc. Of course it’s an orc. Its hair is white. It’s got a luster to it so it could look silver too. Coincidentally Renji’s hair is silver too.Is there a rule saying silver-haired guys have to be insane? Because that orc is clearly insane too. Its body is big and on top of wearing black armor it’s got this cape with a tiger stripe pattern that’s actually probably real tiger fur which is insanely flashy. Those tattoos all over its face are insane. The look in its eyes is insane. Its yellow eyes look so wild it’s insane. Despite that its expression is calm and it looks pretty smart which is insane.And then there’s the sword. The one-edged sword that orc has is purpleish long thick and sharp-looking with a jagged back side that looks insane.,,0,,0,yellow,1,,0,1

My last holiday was a five-day trip to Prague in the Czech Republic. I know Prague well because I lived there when I was at university more than ten years ago.Instead of staying in a hotel I stayed with one of my old friends. It was so much fun and a little bit like my old life. I wanted to do all the same things I did in my university days so I visited the university. It has changed a lot and looks more modern. I also went to the supermarket near my old house. I loved seeing all the different foods. I was really happy to find my favourite cheese and chocolate biscuits but they were a bit more expensive than I remember!We did some touristy things too. We walked up beautiful Petrin Hill and around the castle. The views of the city are amazing up there. We walked across the historic Charles Bridge. My friend’s flat is very near the TV Tower so we saw the famous baby statues climbing up it. Those things haven’t changed of course.,things university days,1,,0,,0,Charles Bridge,1,0

There were so many things that we had bought for our family day at the beach like snacks and refreshments and meats and rice and so the list goes on. Now that the day had finally arrived I was ready to spend a wonderful time with my parents at the beach. On Sunday morning my mom and dad had been busy cooking the food in the kitchen while I helped packed the refreshments in a large cooler box with ice.By the time my parents had finished preparing the food they had packed it into a large box with plates and spoons and forks. Then we had started packing everything into our family caravan. Soon in the next hour we were driving through the main road and we were on our way to the beach which is actually my favorite place in the world so far.The sea water was blue and beautiful as it sparkles in the warm sun. There were a few people here and there on the beach. Some were busy playing cricket while a few kids were building sand castles just for fun. There were at least three or six people for the most already bathing in the clear blue sea water. By the time we had gotten out from the caravan I was already excited to go into the water and enjoy a fine sea bath. My mom had seemed to have read my mind so she told me that’s it lunch first and then we all can go into the water.,sunday,1,next hour,1,,0,people beach,1,1

We spent there marvelous time playing volleyball on the beach and swimming in the sea. One sunny day we were walking on the beach. It was stiflingly hot so I went to the shop to buy something cold to drink. My friends said that they would be waiting for me in a park near the shop. The shop was small so I found the bottle of cola quickly. I paid for it at a checkout and I wanted to get back to my friends but I couldn’t open the door. Although another person wanted to open the door they also weren’t able to do it. Suddenly there appeared men in black. I couldn’t call my friends because I left the mobile in a hotel room. They were talking with each other. But I didn’t know about what. An hour later the door was opened. And I came back to my friends who were very nervous. Then I got to know that one man had taken something and wanted to run away. Security had closed the door to catch the thief. I didn’t come back to that shop anymore.,one sunny day,1,hour,1,,0,,0,0
We went there by my car. It took long time to reach Bandung. It was about 2 hours and we had so many traffics in Bandung. As people could see Bandung is almost the same with Jakarta but the differences are in it’s culture. Not only that Bandung also had so many cold areas like Ciater etc. It was so wonderful in Bandung. I could release all my things at there. After we arrived in Bandung city we had a look at another places like ITB UNPAD etc. Then we had a lunch in a small restaurant. After lunch we continued our way to Ciater. Hope less it had a big traffic in the way to Ciater. So we stopped in a café until evening. Then we continued our way. It was so dark and it was scary on the left or right side. Only trees that we could see because we took pick the way to the higher place.

While it is undisputed that 2016’s ‘hot toy’ was the Hatchimal it is unclear how much shoppers paid for the toy in the secondary market or how resellers fared. Using data on 34657 completed successful Hatchimal eBay auctions by 16726 sellers between October 13 and December 24 2016 I find that shoppers paid an average of $143.67 for the $60 toy.,October 13 December 24 2016,1,,0,,0,,0,1
we continued our walk it took us through the grounds on the edge of the Topkapi Palace the primary residence for the Ottoman Sultans and their Harem. At dusk the Palace proper was closed but the park grounds enjoy heavy foot traffic as families and young lovers had pick nicks on the grass and as people wandered around enjoying the cool(er) summer night air.From there our walk took us along the rocky shores of the Bosphorus River which forms the boundary between the part of Istanbul which is in Europe and the part which is Asia.  Some people were fishing along the river some were roasting corn or meats and still others were stopped to watch the sunset over the opposite shore.,,0,summer night,1,,0,edge topkapi palace,1,0
the fun started just down the street from our hotel where we saw this factory outlet store that sold discounted Magic Lamps (apparently) and also fez. We had to bring back a bright red fez for our son because we have it on very good authority (Matt Smith’s Doctor no less) that fezzes are cool and of course they are.And then of course we felt an urgent need to eat Turkish Delight on a moonlit night (hearing a certain set of song lyrics echoing in our heads) and we discovered the enormous range of different kinds of Turkish candies on offer most of which come in long strips which the candy butchers snip snip with scissors before dropping chunks into custom-selected sampler boxes.  By now my sweet tooth is legendary all over Europe so I was certainly not going to resist this kind of temptation.,,0,,0,matt smith,1,,0,0

They could overlook the river and the far-flung snow-capped peaks of the Himalayas. A visit to the Vashishta Baths was really a thrilling experience. They visited the Hidimba Temple and the famous Vyas shrine. Many European tourists had adopted a village near the river. They were in the news for the wrong reasons. Many of them were drug addicts and hard drunkards. The visit to the Salang Valley and the famous Rohtang Pass was really very exciting and an incredible experience. They say good things don’t last long. They had made arrangements to stay in Manali and Kullu for twenty days. But this was not to be.

A cool breeze blowed. I can hear the soft rustle of leaves. The air is heavy with the scent of grasses coupled with the scent of ripe durians. I can’t wait to eat durians if there’s some at home. I hope so.I lied on my back with my hand behind my head and watched streaks of sunlight filtering through the canopy of leaves. Soon I fall into short but deep slumber. When I woke up I can see the sun slowly descending behind a row of far hills. Although I would love to linger for a little longer I moved away reluctantly and leaved knowing that my grandparents and family would be waiting for me. ,,0,,0,cool breeze,1,far hills,1,0

My last holiday was a five-day trip to Prague in the Czech Republic. I know Prague well because I lived there when I was at university more than ten years ago.Instead of staying in a hotel I stayed with one of my old friends. It was so much fun and a little bit like my old life. I wanted to do all the same things I did in my university days so I visited the university. It has changed a lot and looks more modern. I also went to the supermarket near my old house. I loved seeing all the different foods. I was really happy to find my favourite cheese and chocolate biscuits but they were a bit more expensive than I remember!We did some touristy things too. We walked up beautiful Petrin Hill and around the castle. The views of the city are amazing up there. We walked across the historic Charles Bridge. My friend’s flat is very near the TV Tower so we saw the famous baby statues climbing up it. Those things haven’t changed of course.,things university days,1,,0,,0,Charles Bridge,1,0

There were so many things that we had bought for our family day at the beach like snacks and refreshments and meats and rice and so the list goes on. Now that the day had finally arrived I was ready to spend a wonderful time with my parents at the beach. On Sunday morning my mom and dad had been busy cooking the food in the kitchen while I helped packed the refreshments in a large cooler box with ice.By the time my parents had finished preparing the food they had packed it into a large box with plates and spoons and forks. Then we had started packing everything into our family caravan. Soon in the next hour we were driving through the main road and we were on our way to the beach which is actually my favorite place in the world so far.The sea water was blue and beautiful as it sparkles in the warm sun. There were a few people here and there on the beach. Some were busy playing cricket while a few kids were building sand castles just for fun. There were at least three or six people for the most already bathing in the clear blue sea water. By the time we had gotten out from the caravan I was already excited to go into the water and enjoy a fine sea bath. My mom had seemed to have read my mind so she told me that’s it lunch first and then we all can go into the water.,sunday,1,next hour,1,,0,people beach,1,1

The shop was small so I found the bottle of cola quickly. I paid for it at a checkout and I wanted to get back to my friends but I couldn’t open the door. Although another person wanted to open the door they also weren’t able to do it. Suddenly there appeared men in black. I couldn’t call my friends because I left the mobile in a hotel room. They were talking with each other. But I didn’t know about what. An hour later the door was opened. And I came back to my friends who were very nervous.

I could release all my things at there. After we arrived in Bandung city we had a look at another places like ITB UNPAD etc. Then we had a lunch in a small restaurant. After lunch we continued our way to Ciater. Hope less it had a big traffic in the way to Ciater. So we stopped in a café until evening. Then we continued our way.

While it is undisputed that 2016’s ‘hot toy’ was the Hatchimal it is unclear how much shoppers paid for the toy in the secondary market or how resellers fared.

At dusk the Palace proper was closed but the park grounds enjoy heavy foot traffic as families and young lovers had pick nicks on the grass and as people wandered around enjoying the cool(er) summer night air.From there our walk took us along the rocky shores of the Bosphorus River which forms the boundary between the part of Istanbul which is in Europe and the part which is Asia.  Some people were fishing along the river some were roasting corn or meats and still others were stopped to watch the sunset over the opposite shore.,,0,summer night,1,,0,edge topkapi palace,1,0
the fun started just down the street from our hotel where we saw this factory outlet store that sold discounted Magic Lamps (apparently) and also fez. We had to bring back a bright red fez for our son because we have it on very good authority (Matt Smith’s Doctor no less) that fezzes are cool and of course they are.And then of course we felt an urgent need to eat Turkish Delight on a moonlit night (hearing a certain set of song lyrics echoing in our heads) and we discovered the enormous range of different kinds of Turkish candies on offer most of which come in long strips which the candy butchers snip snip with scissors before dropping chunks into custom-selected sampler boxes.  By now my sweet tooth is legendary all over Europe so I was certainly not going to resist this kind of temptation.,,0,,0,matt smith,1,,0,0

Mohit was excited. His father had made arrangements for a trip to Kullu and Manali during the holiday. Preparations had started a week before. He was told that sometimes even summer nights can be quite cold if it rains. So some woollen clothes were also packed up along with other clothes.

A cool breeze blowed. I can hear the soft rustle of leaves. The air is heavy with the scent of grasses coupled with the scent of ripe durians. I can’t wait to eat durians if there’s some at home. I hope so.I lied on my back with my hand behind my head and watched streaks of sunlight filtering through the canopy of leaves. Soon I fall into short but deep slumber.

Many people take their main holiday in summer and although some people choose a last-minute break others plan their holiday months in advance. The beginning of the year is a good time for people to start looking at holiday brochures. Tour operators (companies that organise holidays) as well as travel agents (the people that sell holidays) give lots of information about holiday destinations and types of holiday.,holiday summer,1,last-minute,1,,0,,0,0

When I was in the 2nd grade of senior high school my friends and I went to Bali. We were there for three days. I had many impressive experiences during the vacation.First day we visited Sanur Beach in the morning. We saw the beautiful sunrise together. It was a great scenery. Then we checked in to the hotel. After prepared our selves we went to Tanah Lot. We met so many other tourists there. They were not only domestic but also foreign tourists.Second day we enjoyed the day on Tanjung Benoa beach. We played so many water sports such as banana boat jetsky speedboat etc. We also went to Penyu island to see many unique animals. There were turtles snakes and sea birds. We were very happy. In the afternoon we went to Kuta Beach to see the amazing sunset and enjoyed the beautiful wave.,three days,1,afternoon,1,jetsky,1,kuta beach,1,1
We spent there marvelous time playing volleyball on the beach and swimming in the sea. One sunny day we were walking on the beach. It was stiflingly hot so I went to the shop to buy something cold to drink. My friends said that they would be waiting for me in a park near the shop. The shop was small so I found the bottle of cola quickly. I paid for it at a checkout and I wanted to get back to my friends but I couldn’t open the door. Although another person wanted to open the door they also weren’t able to do it. Suddenly there appeared men in black. I couldn’t call my friends because I left the mobile in a hotel room. They were talking with each other. But I didn’t know about what. An hour later the door was opened. And I came back to my friends who were very nervous. Then I got to know that one man had taken something and wanted to run away. Security had closed the door to catch the thief. I didn’t come back to that shop anymore.,one sunny day,1,hour,1,,0,,0,0
We went there by my car. It took long time to reach Bandung. It was about 2 hours and we had so many traffics in Bandung. As people could see Bandung is almost the same with Jakarta but the differences are in it’s culture. Not only that Bandung also had so many cold areas like Ciater etc. It was so wonderful in Bandung. I could release all my things at there. After we arrived in Bandung city we had a look at another places like ITB UNPAD etc. Then we had a lunch in a small restaurant. After lunch we continued our way to Ciater. Hope less it had a big traffic in the way to Ciater. So we stopped in a café until evening. Then we continued our way. It was so dark and it was scary on the left or right side. Only trees that we could see because we took pick the way to the higher place. Finally we arrived in Ciater.,,0,evening,1,,0,bandung city,1,0
While it is undisputed that 2016’s ‘hot toy’ was the Hatchimal it is unclear how much shoppers paid for the toy in the secondary market or how resellers fared. Using data on 34657 completed successful Hatchimal eBay auctions by 16726 sellers between October 13 and December 24 2016 I find that shoppers paid an average of $143.67 for the $60 toy.,October 13 December 24 2016,1,,0,,0,,0,1
we continued our walk it took us through the grounds on the edge of the Topkapi Palace the primary residence for the Ottoman Sultans and their Harem. At dusk the Palace proper was closed but the park grounds enjoy heavy foot traffic as families and young lovers had pick nicks on the grass and as people wandered around enjoying the cool(er) summer night air.From there our walk took us along the rocky shores of the Bosphorus River which forms the boundary between the part of Istanbul which is in Europe and the part which is Asia.  Some people were fishing along the river some were roasting corn or meats and still others were stopped to watch the sunset over the opposite shore.,,0,summer night,1,,0,edge topkapi palace,1,0
the fun started just down the street from our hotel where we saw this factory outlet store that sold discounted Magic Lamps (apparently) and also fez. We had to bring back a bright red fez for our son because we have it on very good authority (Matt Smith’s Doctor no less) that fezzes are cool and of course they are.And then of course we felt an urgent need to eat Turkish Delight on a moonlit night (hearing a certain set of song lyrics echoing in our heads) and we discovered the enormous range of different kinds of Turkish candies on offer most of which come in long strips which the candy butchers snip snip with scissors before dropping chunks into custom-selected sampler boxes.  By now my sweet tooth is legendary all over Europe so I was certainly not going to resist this kind of temptation.,,0,,0,matt smith,1,,0,0
A man elbows your character in a crowd. After he is gone she discovers her cell phone is too. She calls her own number and the man answers. She explains that the cell phone has personal information on it and asks the man to send it back to her. He hangs up. Instead of going to the police your character decides to take matters into her own hands... After your character loses his job he is home during the day. That’s how he discovers that his teenage son has a small marijuana plantation behind the garage. Your character confronts his son who instead of acting repentant explains to your character exactly how much money he is making from the marijuana and tries to persuade your character to join in the business...,,0,,0,,0,marijuana,1,0
They could overlook the river and the far-flung snow-capped peaks of the Himalayas. A visit to the Vashishta Baths was really a thrilling experience. They visited the Hidimba Temple and the famous Vyas shrine. Many European tourists had adopted a village near the river. They were in the news for the wrong reasons. Many of them were drug addicts and hard drunkards. The visit to the Salang Valley and the famous Rohtang Pass was really very exciting and an incredible experience. They say good things don’t last long. They had made arrangements to stay in Manali and Kullu for twenty days. But this was not to be.

My last holiday was in Germany. I’m growed up there so it isn’t quite a common tourist holiday for me.I went by car with my wife and our four kids.

My last holiday was a five-day trip to Prague in the Czech Republic. I know Prague well because I lived there when I was at university more than ten years ago.Instead of staying in a hotel I stayed with one of my old friends. It was so much fun and a little bit like my old life. I wanted to do all the same things I did in my university days so I visited the university. It has changed a lot and looks more modern. I also went to the supermarket near my old house. I loved seeing all the different foods. I was really happy to find my favourite cheese and chocolate biscuits but they were a bit more expensive than I remember!We did some touristy things too. We walked up beautiful Petrin Hill and around the castle. The views of the city are amazing up there. We walked across the historic Charles Bridge. My friend’s flat is very near the TV Tower so we saw the famous baby statues climbing up it. Those things haven’t changed of course.,things university days,1,,0,,0,Charles Bridge,1,0

There were so many things that we had bought for our family day at the beach like snacks and refreshments and meats and rice and so the list goes on. Now that the day had finally arrived I was ready to spend a wonderful time with my parents at the beach. On Sunday morning my mom and dad had been busy cooking the food in the kitchen while I helped packed the refreshments in a large cooler box with ice.By the time my parents had finished preparing the food they had packed it into a large box with plates and spoons and forks. Then we had started packing everything into our family caravan. Soon in the next hour we were driving through the main road and we were on our way to the beach which is actually my favorite place in the world so far.The sea water was blue and beautiful as it sparkles in the warm sun. There were a few people here and there on the beach. Some were busy playing cricket while a few kids were building sand castles just for fun. There were at least three or six people for the most already bathing in the clear blue sea water. By the time we had gotten out from the caravan I was already excited to go into the water and enjoy a fine sea bath. My mom had seemed to have read my mind so she told me that’s it lunch first and then we all can go into the water.,sunday,1,next hour,1,,0,people beach,1,1

It was stiflingly hot so I went to the shop to buy something cold to drink. My friends said that they would be waiting for me in a park near the shop. The shop was small so I found the bottle of cola quickly. I paid for it at a checkout and I wanted to get back to my friends but I couldn’t open the door. Although another person wanted to open the door they also weren’t able to do it. Suddenly there appeared men in black. I couldn’t call my friends because I left the mobile in a hotel room. They were talking with each other. But I didn’t know about what. An hour later the door was opened. And I came back to my friends who were very nervous.

While it is undisputed that 2016’s ‘hot toy’ was the Hatchimal it is unclear how much shoppers paid for the toy in the secondary market or how resellers fared.

Many people take their main holiday in summer and although some people choose a last-minute break others plan their holiday months in advance. The beginning of the year is a good time for people to start looking at holiday brochures. Tour operators (companies that organise holidays) as well as travel agents (the people that sell holidays) give lots of information about holiday destinations and types of holiday.,holiday summer,1,last-minute,1,,0,,0,0

Didn’t you enjoy the boat ride? Oh yes I did. But I enjoyed the food most of all. Ratan is an expert cook. The chicken curry was delicious. That’s right and the journey back home was also so fine.

When I was in the 2nd grade of senior high school my friends and I went to Bali. We were there for three days. I had many impressive experiences during the vacation.First day we visited Sanur Beach in the morning. We saw the beautiful sunrise together. It was a great scenery. Then we checked in to the hotel. After prepared our selves we went to Tanah Lot. We met so many other tourists there. They were not only domestic but also foreign tourists.Second day we enjoyed the day on Tanjung Benoa beach. We played so many water sports such as banana boat jetsky speedboat etc. We also went to Penyu island to see many unique animals. There were turtles snakes and sea birds. We were very happy. In the afternoon we went to Kuta Beach to see the amazing sunset and enjoyed the beautiful wave.,three days,1,afternoon,1,jetsky,1,kuta beach,1,1
We spent there marvelous time playing volleyball on the beach and swimming in the sea. One sunny day we were walking on the beach. It was stiflingly hot so I went to the shop to buy something cold to drink. My friends said that they would be waiting for me in a park near the shop. The shop was small so I found the bottle of cola quickly. I paid for it at a checkout and I wanted to get back to my friends but I couldn’t open the door. Although another person wanted to open the door they also weren’t able to do it. Suddenly there appeared men in black. I couldn’t call my friends because I left the mobile in a hotel room. They were talking with each other. But I didn’t know about what. An hour later the door was opened. And I came back to my friends who were very nervous. Then I got to know that one man had taken something and wanted to run away. Security had closed the door to catch the thief. I didn’t come back to that shop anymore.,one sunny day,1,hour,1,,0,,0,0
We went there by my car. It took long time to reach Bandung. It was about 2 hours and we had so many traffics in Bandung. As people could see Bandung is almost the same with Jakarta but the differences are in it’s culture. Not only that Bandung also had so many cold areas like Ciater etc. It was so wonderful in Bandung. I could release all my things at there. After we arrived in Bandung city we had a look at another places like ITB UNPAD etc. Then we had a lunch in a small restaurant. After lunch we continued our way to Ciater. Hope less it had a big traffic in the way to Ciater. So we stopped in a café until evening. Then we continued our way. It was so dark and it was scary on the left or right side. Only trees that we could see because we took pick the way to the higher place. Finally we arrived in Ciater.,,0,evening,1,,0,bandung city,1,0
While it is undisputed that 2016’s ‘hot toy’ was the Hatchimal it is unclear how much shoppers paid for the toy in the secondary market or how resellers fared. Using data on 34657 completed successful Hatchimal eBay auctions by 16726 sellers between October 13 and December 24 2016 I find that shoppers paid an average of $143.67 for the $60 toy.,October 13 December 24 2016,1,,0,,0,,0,1
we continued our walk it took us through the grounds on the edge of the Topkapi Palace the primary residence for the Ottoman Sultans and their Harem. At dusk the Palace proper was closed but the park grounds enjoy heavy foot traffic as families and young lovers had pick nicks on the grass and as people wandered around enjoying the cool(er) summer night air.From there our walk took us along the rocky shores of the Bosphorus River which forms the boundary between the part of Istanbul which is in Europe and the part which is Asia.  Some people were fishing along the river some were roasting corn or meats and still others were stopped to watch the sunset over the opposite shore.,,0,summer night,1,,0,edge topkapi palace,1,0
the fun started just down the street from our hotel where we saw this factory outlet store that sold discounted Magic Lamps (apparently) and also fez. We had to bring back a bright red fez for our son because we have it on very good authority (Matt Smith’s Doctor no less) that fezzes are cool and of course they are.And then of course we felt an urgent need to eat Turkish Delight on a moonlit night (hearing a certain set of song lyrics echoing in our heads) and we discovered the enormous range of different kinds of Turkish candies on offer most of which come in long strips which the candy butchers snip snip with scissors before dropping chunks into custom-selected sampler boxes.  By now my sweet tooth is legendary all over Europe so I was certainly not going to resist this kind of temptation.,,0,,0,matt smith,1,,0,0

They could overlook the river and the far-flung snow-capped peaks of the Himalayas. A visit to the Vashishta Baths was really a thrilling experience. They visited the Hidimba Temple and the famous Vyas shrine. Many European tourists had adopted a village near the river. They were in the news for the wrong reasons. Many of them were drug addicts and hard drunkards. The visit to the Salang Valley and the famous Rohtang Pass was really very exciting and an incredible experience. They say good things don’t last long. They had made arrangements to stay in Manali and Kullu for twenty days. But this was not to be.

I eagerly waited for the bell to ring at 1:30 p.m..Then I felt like a caged bird hat has just been set free. I slang my bag over my shoulder and make my way to my dorm to pick up some bags to bring home. I waited for my mother for a couple of minutes. Finally she came. I put my bags in the car and hoped in. In the car my mother told me that the whole family is going to our hometown. I felt very excited because I missed my hometown very much.

A cool breeze blowed. I can hear the soft rustle of leaves. The air is heavy with the scent of grasses coupled with the scent of ripe durians. I can’t wait to eat durians if there’s some at home. I hope so.I lied on my back with my hand behind my head and watched streaks of sunlight filtering through the canopy of leaves. Soon I fall into short but deep slumber. When I woke up I can see the sun slowly descending behind a row of far hills. Although I would love to linger for a little longer I moved away reluctantly and leaved knowing that my grandparents and family would be waiting for me. ,,0,,0,cool breeze,1,far hills,1,0
